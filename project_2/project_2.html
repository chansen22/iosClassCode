<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>You will build a photo viewer application which offers two different ways for
the user to view photos.  The app will have two tabs where each tab is a different
viewing experience of the same set of photos.  The set of photos is divided into
categories.  Each category has a name and a set of photos.</p>

<p>The first tab will show the photos in their category grouping in a “grid” view.
This view is implemented with a <code>UICollectionView</code>.  Tapping on an image in the view
will update the title label to reflect the title of the image that was tapped.</p>

<p>The second tab will show only one photo at a time.  The photo to show will be
chosen from a <code>UIPickerView</code>.  The first component of the picker view will
be a list of the photo categories.  The second component will be a list of the
photo titles for the selected category.  When a category is chosen, the user
can then choose between specific photos in the given category.  Upon selection
of an image, the photo will be displayed to the user.  The user will then have
the ability to adjust the opacity of the selected image via a <code>UISlider</code> control.
The opacity slider will affect the <code>alpha</code> setting of the <code>UIImageView</code>.  Sliding
it to one extreme will render the image completely invisible, while at the other
extreme the image will be completely opaque.</p>

<p>I have prepared a <a href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~chmorris/csci567/projects/02/demo.mov">demo video</a> of the app.</p>

<h3 id="the-grid-tab">The Grid Tab</h3>

<p>The grid tab is composed of a <code>UICollectionView</code>.  You will need to create a custom
<code>UICollectionViewCell</code> which will only have an IBOutlet property for a <code>UIImageView</code>
in the header.  The implementation will be empty.  This is for the individual cells
of the collection view.  In addition, you will need to create a custom 
<code>UICollectionReusableView</code> for the header.  This will only have an IBOutlet property
for the <code>UILabel</code> in the header.  Its implementation will also be empty.  (By empty, I
mean that there is nothing to implement between the <code>@implementation</code> and <code>@end</code>.)</p>

<p>Your <code>UIViewController</code> will need to implement the 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UICollectionViewDataSource_protocol/Reference/Reference.html">UICollectionViewDataSource Protocol</a> as well as the
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UICollectionViewDelegate_protocol/Reference/Reference.html">UICollectionViewDelegate Protocol</a>.  All of the methods are not required to be implemented.  Only a couple
of them are needed.</p>

<p>Tapping on a cell in the collection view will cause the title label to be updated with
the title of the image that was tapped.</p>

<p>An example might look like this:</p>

<p><img src="./project_2_files/grid_1.png" alt="Grid Example 1"></p>

<p>After a cell has been tapped:</p>

<p><img src="./project_2_files/grid_2.png" alt="Grid Example 2"></p>

<h3 id="the-picker-tab">The Picker Tab</h3>

<p>The picker tab does not require any additional helper classes like the grid tab, and in
fact, might be an easier place to start.  Your view controller will have one IBOutlet to a
<code>UIImageView</code>, so that you can update the <code>image</code> property when an item in the <code>UIPickerView</code>
is selected.  Also, you can update the <code>alpha</code> property when the <code>UISlider</code> is adjusted.</p>

<p>Your view controller will need to implement the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iPhone/Reference/UIPickerViewDataSource_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html">UIPickerViewDataSource Protocol</a> as well as the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIPickerViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/UIPickerViewDelegate.html">UIPickerViewDelegate Protocol</a>.  Like the datasource and delegate protocols in the grid view,
you will not need to implement all of the methods of the protocols.</p>

<p>An example application might look like this:</p>

<p><img src="./project_2_files/picker_1.png" alt="Photo Viewer Application"></p>

<p>With the opacity slider set:</p>

<p><img src="./project_2_files/picker_2.png" alt="Photo Viewer Application"></p>

<h2 id="the-property-list">The Property List</h2>
<p>You will store the photo library in a property list file which you can create
in Xcode via the menu <code>New File =&gt; Resource =&gt; Property List</code>.  The file will
be composed of a dictionary where the keys represent the category titles, and
the values are in turn dictionaries with the key being the photo title, and 
the value being the photo file name.  The actual image files will simply be
bundled with the project.  A good place to put them is in the “Supporting Files”
group in Xcode.</p>

<p>The property list file might look like this:</p>

<p><img src="./project_2_files/property_list.png" alt="Property List File"></p>

<p>In order to read the property list file into an <code>NSDictionary</code> object,
you must first get the path to the resource.  This can be done as follows:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"photos" ofType:@"plist"];
</code></pre>

<p>Note: The name of my property list is “photos.plist”</p>

<p>Once you have the path to the property list, you can read it into an 
<code>NSDictionary</code> object as follows:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *photoList = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile:path];
</code></pre>

<p>Part of the goal for this assignment is to become more familiar with the Foundation classes
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDictionary_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSDictionary</a>
and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/NSArray.html">NSArray</a>.</p>

<p>I expect that you will need to consult the documentation to figure out how to use these classes appropriately.  Of
particular interest will be the sorting which can be found <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/NSArray.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSArray/sortedArrayUsingSelector:">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-model">The Model</h2>

<p>You will create a model which will know all about the photos in your library.
It will be called <code>PhotoLibrary</code>.  The public interface for your  model will
be the following:</p>

<pre><code>    #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
    
    @interface PhotoLibrary : NSObject
    - (NSUInteger)numberOfCategories;
    - (NSString *)nameForCategory:(NSUInteger)category;
    - (NSUInteger)numberOfPhotosInCategory:(NSUInteger)category;
    - (NSString *)nameForPhotoInCategory:(NSUInteger)category
                              atPosition:(NSUInteger)position;
    - (UIImage *)imageForPhotoInCategory:(NSUInteger)category
                              atPosition:(NSUInteger)position;
    @end
</code></pre>

<p>You will use this model in both of your view controllers.  You can create a separate
model instance for each controller.  (If you want to try to create a shared singleton
instance, I encourage it, but it is not required.)</p>

      <li>The photo titles within each category will be sorted alphabetically</li>
      <li>In the picker tab the images will not be distorted in the <code>UIImageView</code>    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You are expected to complete this assignment individually.</li>
  <li>A model will be used to represent the “Photo Library”</li>
  <li>The MVC design pattern will be adhered to, with the view controllers deferring
to the model for any picture related information.</li>
  <li>All of the photos will be different.  (I don’t care where you get them from.)</li>
  <li>The photo library data will be loaded from a property list file</li>
  <li>Your program will compile and run without errors or warnings.</li>
  <li>Your program will not crash for any reason.</li>
  <li>Code is clean and easy to read.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The opacity of a <code>UIImageView</code> can be adjusted by setting the <code>alpha</code> value
which is in the range of 0.0 to 1.0  </li>
  <li>Look at the <code>mode</code> option on the <code>UIImageView</code> to make sure that the image
in the picker tab is not distorted.</li>
  <li>If the photos are smaller in size, they will load much faster.</li>
  <li>You can get a <code>UIImage</code> object easily using the <code>imageNamed:</code> method.</li>
  <li>I found the tab bar icons for my app <a href="http://www.graphicsfuel.com/2013/01/45-ios-tab-bar-icons-psd-png/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bonus-features">Bonus Features</h2>
<p>You are welcomed and encouraged to add additional features to your program.
I will award extra credit for well implemented features enhancements.</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>By the due date/time you are expected to have committed your working xcode
